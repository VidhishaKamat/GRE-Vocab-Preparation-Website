            <p><b class="info">What is the GRE?</b></p>
               <p> Every year over 200,000 students take the Graduate Examination (GRE) in order to pursue higher education. There are approximately 1,000 authorized GRE centers spread out over 160 countries. If you are interested in applying to a graduate program or business school, the GRE is most likely part of your future. Most take the GRE General Test, but there are also subject GREs. The subjects include: Biology, Chemistry, Literature in English, Mathematics, Physics and Psychology. The majority of colleges accept individuals based on their GRE score, personal statement essay, transcript, and recommendation. Depending on which program you apply to, the GRE could be a major factor in being considered a suitable candidate. This guide hopes to offer you key tools and advice to successfully conquering the GRE. After all, the GRE is viewed as a test that aides universities in determining/identifying who will succeed.</p>
        <p><b class="info">Do most data science programs require the GRE?</b></p>
        <p>As of January 2021, more than 55% of the graduate data science programs listed on the site require the GRE as part of the admissions process. At this time, 100% of the Ph.D. programs we have listed require the GRE. Some programs do not require it but heavily suggest you take the test – in that case it would be a good idea to sit for the exam.</p>
        <p><b class="info">Why take the GRE?</b></p>
        <p>The GRE is a standardized test that is found in addition to transcripts and letters of recommendations; providing graduate school admissions with insight on potential students’ levels of fundamental knowledge. The reasoning, critical thinking and analytical skills tested by the GRE offer schools the information they need to determine if student will succeed in graduate level classes.</p>  
        <p><b class="info">Signing up for the Test</b></p>
        <p>If you are currently working on an undergraduate program and want to move to your graduate career immediately after graduation, it is recommended that you sign up for the GRE during your Junior year. A majority of individuals take the GRE in October in order to comply with college application deadlines. If you are thinking of taking the GRE more than once, you should also consider this when making the decision to take the test.

            When is the best time to take the GRE? The most beneficial time to take the GRE is when you feel prepared.
            
            The GRE has a cost of $205; additional charges might apply.</p>
        <p><b class="info">  Preparations Needed</b></p>
        <p>The GRE is a very important test. Most experts recommend that test takers prepare at least 8-12 weeks in advance. There is a vast amount of resources that can help you prepare. The providers of the test (the Educational Testing Service (ETS)) have a lot of free and reasonably priced resources that should be taken advantage of by test takers. There are also many types of books, online sources, videos and test prep courses. You can save money when you buy older edition test prep books.  Bear in mind that the GRE was revamped in 2011. Books published prior to 2011 should not be used, for the outdated material will prove irrelevant to your success. Regardless of what works best for you, the number one thing we recommend is that you truly get familiarized with the test. The phrase “practice makes perfect,” applies to the GRE. The more practice tests you take the closer you will be to reaching your ideal score. It is also important that you track your progress. If you are not getting the desired results, we strongly recommend that a one on one prep course or a tutor be considered. There is no shame in looking for the help of experts. You want to have all the tools that will prepare you to get the best possible score.
            The GRE will test you in more ways than you can imagine. We recommend that when you take practice tests, that you treat them as if you were taking the real exam. It is important to prepare for the material, but it is equally as important to conquer the psychological aspect of taking the real exam. There are many bright individuals who cannot deal with the pressure that comes when you enter the testing site and it ultimately takes a toll on their score. Be prepared mentally so you can truly focus on taking the exam. Relax.</p>
        <p><b class="info">Grading/ Sending scores to schools </b></p>
        <p>The GRE is not a pass or fail exam, so test takers want to ensure they get the best score possible. The GRE is scored on a range of 130 to 170. The average GRE score is somewhere in the low 150’s. If your goal is a top tier school, a score in the 160’s might be needed. Two reviewers score the analytical writing section. The score is a result of the average from both scores which is then rounded off to the nearest 1.5 points. If the score for both readers is vastly different, a third reader evaluates the test. It takes approximately two weeks after the test to receive the score of the analytical writing section.

            Since the GRE is administered via computer, at the end of the test you are given your score for the verbal reasoning and quantitative section. Before the test taker is given his or her score, they are asked if they want to view their score. If you choose to know your score you leave the test center with the results. On the other hand, if you feel you did poorly on the GRE you have the option to not know. In other words, the test taker can choose to cancel his/her score, and the test taker nor anyone else will know.
            
            Before the test, you are given the option to select up to four colleges that you want the ETS to send your score to for free. You can also opt out from choosing any colleges at that time. Scores and additional scores can be sent out later via the ETS website, but they will be at an additional cost regardless of whether or not it’s your first score.
            
            Once you take the GRE your score will be valid for 5 years from the date the test was taken.  Unlike other entrance exams, the GRE allows you to send only your highest score or all your scores to the colleges of your choosing. Keeping this in mind, it is encouraged to take the GRE more than once if you feel you can improve your score.</p>
            <p><b class="info">Day of Test</b></p>
            <p>As the exam approaches, it’s normal to feel nervous.  You have done countless hours of studying and have most likely taken many practice tests.  You have the knowledge in your mind but need to make sure you perform to the best of your ability on test day.  Here are some tips for Test Day.</p>

            <p>Get a good night’s sleep:  A tired mind makes more mistakes.</p> 
            <p>Arrive early:  30 minutes early is ideal.  You don’t want to be panicking when you are stuck in traffic.  You will not be in the right mindset to take the test if you are frazzled.</p>
            <p>Dress comfortably and in layers.  You cannot control the temperature of the room at the time of the test.</p>
            <p>Bring a photo ID and registration form. Do not bring in a phone.</p>
            <p>The GRE is on a computer:  There will be a short tutorial to show you the technical part of answering the questions.
                Take a deep breath, relax and focus.</p>
            <p><b class="info">GMAT v. GRE</b></p>
        <p>As previously mentioned, the GRE is for individuals who intend to pursue a graduate program or in some cases business school. The GMAT and the LSAT are other entrance exams. The GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) is for those who wish to go to Business school. Like the GRE, the GMAT is made up of a Verbal and Quantitative section. It is very important to see what the requirements are of the program you choose to apply. In some cases, business schools will give applicants the option of submitting a GRE score instead of a GMAT. If you have this option, we recommend you get familiarized with both tests and determine which one you feel more comfortable with.

            For those interested in becoming lawyers, the LSAT (Law School Admission Test) is for you.
            Data science is an emerging graduate school option.  In the last 5 years, there has been significant growth in the number of data science master’s degrees being offered. A majority of the graduate programs require a GRE or GMAT scores for entry. </p>
